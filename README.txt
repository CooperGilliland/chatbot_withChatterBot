This project is a demonstration of the chatterbot api combined with speech recognition and text to speech capabilities.
The dependencies are the chatterbot, gtts, SpeechRecognition, and pyaudio packages
When running, it will require time to train on the selected corpus prior to user interaction. 
This has been updated to use a more complete corpus.
When operating, the user will be prompted to choose between speech or text at each interaction.
After collecting the user input from the default input device, the bot will formulate a response and
play that response on the default audio player for the device.
