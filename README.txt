This project is a simple demonstration of the chatterbot api.
The requirements are chatterbot, gtts, SpeechRecognition, and pyaudio
When running, it will require time to train on the selected corpus prior to user interaction. 
This has been updated to use a more complete corpus. 
I am going to update this project to use a command line player, rather than relying on an
external mp3 player.
